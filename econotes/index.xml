What information is contained in co-occurrence data? I don&amp;#39;t have a definitive answer to this question but assuming co-occurrence data are proxies for ecological interactions could lead to erroneous conclusions, we explain why in this new piece https://t.co/Ze9o7pfZNF
&amp;mdash; Kevin Cazelles (@KCazelles) May 20, 2020 What did we do? We basically went over 7 arguments to explain why the information in co-occurrence cannot be taken as a proxy for ecological interactions.</description></item><item><title>Never too late to publish your code!</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/econotes/2020/biogeonet/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/econotes/2020/biogeonet/</guid><description>Since 2017, for every article I work on, I now do my best to release the code I used to obtain the results presented therein (see my research compendia in the software section). In my humble opinion, this is the least I can do cause the numerical part of a study (often a large part of my work) is relatively easy to reproduce, though it requires some time to master the tools to do so.</description></item><item><title>Homogenization of freshwater lakes</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/econotes/2019/homogenontario/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/econotes/2019/homogenontario/</guid><description>This was originally posted on https://mccannlab.ca/post/2019/09/20/homogenization-of-freshwater-lakes/
English version 🇬🇧 What happened to fish communities in Ontario lakes over the last few decades? We have been relentlessly looking for answers to this question! Indeed, we did our best to determine whether global change has affected those communities over the last 40 years. It turns out that fish communities in Ontario lakes are pretty different from what they were, but climate change does not explain those changes 💥!</description></item><item><title>Towards an integrated theory of biogeography</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/econotes/2016/towards-an-integrated-theory-of-biogeography/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/econotes/2016/towards-an-integrated-theory-of-biogeography/</guid><description>Dominique Gravel, Nicolas Mouquet, David Mouillot and I have recently published a paper in Ecography entitled &amp;lsquo;On the integration of biotic interaction and environmental constraints at the biogeographical scale&amp;rsquo; where we develop some ideas about how ecological interactions and abiotic factors must be taken together into account to better predict species&amp;rsquo; distribution. As suggested during the editing process, we wrote a blog post for Ecography that summarizes our paper. I think blog posts are an useful way to promote one's work and also a good compromise between reading the abstract and reading the entire paper.</description></item></channel></rss>
