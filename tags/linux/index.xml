After spending almost 2 years on Buster, I decided last week that it was time to migrate to Bullseye.
Backing up I frequently backup my files (so far with a simple bash function that copies them to my external hard drive). Plus, I also have a repository, dotfiles, where I stored my configuration files (the ones I can share).</description></item><item><title>Dual Boot MacOS-Ubuntu</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/macosubuntu/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/macosubuntu/</guid><description>Context I must say that I have been quite unhappy with my old Mac Book Pro (mid 2012) for almost a year now. IIRC, I got it early 2013 and it served me well during my PhD but now it is kind of slow 🐢 and often behaves weirdly on boot. Last weekend fir instance, I got a nasty black screen on boot 😱. Turns out it happens frequently and there are no less than four different solutions to this issue 😱 (in my case, emptying the PRAM did the job)&amp;hellip; Windows, MacOS, blue screen, black screen, yunno&amp;hellip; I found having these issues actually rather worrisome because I care about my computer, I update it frequently and I'm actually capable of solving this kind of issues, so WTF?</description></item><item><title>My Raspberry Pi 3B</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/raspberrypi3b/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/raspberrypi3b/</guid><description>Two years ago now, I bought myself a Raspberry Pi 3B (back in 2015, I bought a model 2B and since June of this year, model 4B is out but has some issues). Even if don't use it as much as I would like to, this small computer never ceases to amaze me! The concept is awesome, the education goals are meaningful and timely and the community is great, just check out the official website https://www.</description></item><item><title>Debian 10 *buster* released</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/buster/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/buster/</guid><description>I have been on Debian buster for more than a year while it was the Debian Testing. After a frozen period that lasted a few months, buster is the new stable Debian distribution since yesterday!
What does this change on my end? Not much! Basically, as I was already using buster in my /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ file, when I used apt-get update I got the following message:

Two weeks ago, just as I described in a previous post, after some updates, I was not able to boot anymore. Given that everything was working very well before, I was convinced that this was an issue with GRUB2, but was not able to fix it despite a very demanding quest for a solution. I was so desperate that I decided to reinstall Debian (which turned out to be a good thing as it fixed minor issues I had with my hardware.</description></item><item><title>How to partition your external hard drive</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/partitionhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/partitionhd/</guid><description>Recently, I formatted an external hard drive and I created several partitions on it. For doing so, I used to very good tools:
Disks (gnome-disks); GParted (GNOME Partition Editor). Both tools are intuitive and makes your live really easy. You can also find good tutorials on line (e.g. looks at this answer on for a step by step GParted tutorial). I've just realized that GParted is actually the GUI for GNU Parted that will try next time I want to partition an hard drive (I've spotted this tuto 😄).</description></item><item><title>Cannot boot after upgrade on Debian Testing `[SOLVED]`</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/cannotboot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/cannotboot/</guid><description>Yesterday, I upgraded some packages on my Debian machine as I regularly do (cannot remember the exact list) but when I rebooted the system, I was not able to access the file system anymore 😱.
It was the first time I had no clue about what I did wrong and also the first time I had no idea of what to do. Basically, every time I started my computer, I ended up on a page I had never seen before where I had only two options:</description></item><item><title>Make your computer talk!</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/sotospeak/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/sotospeak/</guid><description>When I was on MacOS, I really enjoyed the command say to make my macOS speak (another bad reason to procrastinate) and I was looking for a similar tool on Linux to make my Lenovo speak 😄. After a quick search, I found two software: spd-say and espeak. They both offer the same basic options, similar to the ones say provides on MacOS.
spd-say spd-say was already included in the set of tools I install with Debian so I checked out the documentation with man spd-say:</description></item><item><title>From one character encoding to another</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/changeencoding/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/changeencoding/</guid><description>Today I needed to check the character encoding of a file, I found this page that explains how to do this. Basically the command file will give you the info, for instance:
1 2 $ file example.md example.md: ASCII text options -i for --mime and -b for --brief will give:
1 2 $ file -bi example.md text/plain; charset=us-ascii I figured out that I needed to convert my file from one character encoding to another and so I used iconv.</description></item><item><title>How to count non-blank lines of a set of files?</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/countlines/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/countlines/</guid><description>Yesterday, I was trying to find a way to count lines of a set of R files without comments nor empty lines and found this answer on stackoverflow:
1 cat R/* | sed &amp;#39;/^\s*#/d;/^\s*$/d&amp;#39; | wc -l Exactly what I needed! A few explanations are in order:
cat reads files sequentially; &amp;ldquo;|&amp;rdquo; is the the pipe operator; sed parses and transforms text; wc counts words, lines and more!</description></item><item><title>My Lenovo T470p</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/lenovot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/lenovot/</guid><description>When I switched from MacOS to Debian, I had no idea what laptop to buy so I searched for some information on the Internet. As expected it was hard to find reliable sources of information among websites that are obviously not neutral. After a few hours on the net, I ended up buying a Lenovo ThinkPad T470p and installed Debian on, so far so good, very happy I made this choice.</description></item><item><title>Kernel 4.18</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/kernel4_18/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/kernel4_18/</guid><description>On Debian Testing today was a kernel update day! At 9:51am (Guelph time) I was still on kernel 4.17 😱
but at 9:53am, I was working with 4.18 🏆
By the way, the source code of the kernel is mirrored on Github, a repository without an issue section with a $\infty$ number of contributors 😂. Also, there is an exhaustive documentation available at https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/.</description></item></channel></rss>
