VSCode (thus VSCodium) is very powerful, has a tons of features and its development is very dynamic, so I am always keeping an eye on what&amp;rsquo;s new with VSCode even though I am still using Atom more frequently.
When I set up Bullseye on my ThinkPad I installed the latest version of VSCodium and when I looked up for my favorite extensions, I realized that many extensions were actually missing.</description></item><item><title>Migrating from Buster to Bullseye</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/setup_bullseye/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/setup_bullseye/</guid><description>In July 2019, Buster became the stable release of Debian and the Bullseye became de facto the new testing distribution. After spending almost 2 years on Buster, I decided last week that it was time to migrate to Bullseye.
Backing up I frequently backup my files (so far with a simple bash function that copies them to my external hard drive). Plus, I also have a repository, dotfiles, where I stored my configuration files (the ones I can share).</description></item><item><title>Dual Boot MacOS-Ubuntu</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/macosubuntu/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/macosubuntu/</guid><description>Context I must say that I have been quite unhappy with my old Mac Book Pro (mid 2012) for almost a year now. IIRC, I got it early 2013 and it served me well during my PhD but now it is kind of slow üê¢ and often behaves weirdly on boot. Last weekend fir instance, I got a nasty black screen on boot üò±. Turns out it happens frequently and there are no less than four different solutions to this issue üò± (in my case, emptying the PRAM did the job)&amp;hellip; Windows, MacOS, blue screen, black screen, yunno&amp;hellip; I found having these issues actually rather worrisome because I care about my computer, I update it frequently and I&amp;rsquo;m actually capable of solving this kind of issues, so WTF?</description></item><item><title>My Raspberry Pi 3B</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/raspberrypi3b/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/raspberrypi3b/</guid><description>Two years ago now, I bought myself a Raspberry Pi 3B (back in 2015, I bought a model 2B and since June of this year, model 4B is out but has some issues). Even if don&amp;rsquo;t use it as much as I would like to, this small computer never ceases to amaze me!

After a frozen period that lasted a few months, buster is the new stable Debian distribution since yesterday!
What does this change on my end? Not much! Basically, as I was already using buster in my /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ file, when I used apt-get update I got the following message:

Two weeks ago, just as I described in a previous post, after some updates, I was not able to boot anymore. Given that everything was working very well before, I was convinced that this was an issue with GRUB2, but was not able to fix it despite a very demanding quest for a solution. I was so desperate that I decided to reinstall Debian (which turned out to be a good thing as it fixed minor issues I had with my hardware.</description></item><item><title>How to partition your external hard drive</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/partitionhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/partitionhd/</guid><description>Recently, I formatted an external hard drive and I created several partitions on it. For doing so, I used to very good tools:
Disks (gnome-disks); GParted (GNOME Partition Editor). Both tools are intuitive and makes your live really easy. You can also find good tutorials on line (e.g. looks at this answer on for a step by step GParted tutorial). I&amp;rsquo;ve just realized that GParted is actually the GUI for GNU Parted that will try next time I want to partition an hard drive (I&amp;rsquo;ve spotted this tuto üòÑ).</description></item><item><title>Cannot boot after upgrade on Debian Testing `[SOLVED]`</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/cannotboot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/cannotboot/</guid><description>Yesterday, I upgraded some packages on my Debian machine as I regularly do (cannot remember the exact list) but when I rebooted the system, I was not able to access the file system anymore üò±.
It was the first time I had no clue about what I did wrong and also the first time I had no idea of what to do. Basically, every time I started my computer, I ended up on a page I had never seen before where I had only two options:</description></item><item><title>Make your computer talk!</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/sotospeak/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/sotospeak/</guid><description>When I was on MacOS, I really enjoyed the command say to make my macOS speak (another bad reason to procrastinate) and I was looking for a similar tool on Linux to make my Lenovo speak üòÑ. After a quick search, I found two software: spd-say and espeak. They both offer the same basic options, similar to the ones say provides on MacOS.
spd-say spd-say was already included in the set of tools I install with Debian so I checked out the documentation with man spd-say:</description></item><item><title>From one character encoding to another</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/changeencoding/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/changeencoding/</guid><description>Today I needed to check the character encoding of a file, I found this page that explains how to do this. Basically the command file will give you the info, for instance:
1 2 $ file example.md example.md: ASCII text options -i for --mime and -b for --brief will give:
1 2 $ file -bi example.md text/plain; charset=us-ascii I figured out that I needed to convert my file from one character encoding to another and so I used iconv.</description></item><item><title>How to count non-blank lines of a set of files?</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/countlines/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/countlines/</guid><description>Yesterday, I was trying to find a way to count lines of a set of R files without comments nor empty lines and found this answer on stackoverflow:
1 cat R/* | sed &amp;#39;/^\s*#/d;/^\s*$/d&amp;#39; | wc -l Exactly what I needed! A few explanations are in order:
cat reads files sequentially; &amp;quot;|&amp;quot; is the the pipe operator; sed parses and transforms text; wc counts words, lines and more!</description></item><item><title>My Lenovo T470p</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/lenovot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hardware/lenovot/</guid><description>When I switched from MacOS to Debian, I had no idea what laptop to buy so I searched for some information on the Internet. As expected it was hard to find reliable sources of information among websites that are obviously not neutral. After a few hours on the net, I ended up buying a Lenovo ThinkPad T470p and installed Debian on, so far so good, very happy I made this choice.</description></item><item><title>Kernel 4.18</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/kernel4_18/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/linux/kernel4_18/</guid><description>On Debian Testing today was a kernel update day! At 9:51am (Guelph time) I was still on kernel 4.17 üò±
but at 9:53am, I was working with 4.18 üèÜ
By the way, the source code of the kernel is mirrored on Github, a repository without an issue section with a $\infty$ number of contributors üòÇ. Also, there is an exhaustive documentation available at https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/.</description></item></channel></rss>
