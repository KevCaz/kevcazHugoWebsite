I already knew that I would be able to use PDFtk, a smart CLI tool I mentioned in a previous note to combine the pdf files but I was not sure how to proceed for the page numbering. Turns out that PDFtk is also useful for this too!</description></item><item><title>Julia v1.1-rc1 from source</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/julia/juliav1-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/julia/juliav1-1/</guid><description>Learning more about Julia is one of the many things I attempt to do in 2019 ðŸ˜„. Few weeks ago, I installed Julia 1.0.0 using the GitHub repository and I decided to checkout how easy it would be to upgrade to the version to v1.1.0-rc1 (note that &amp;ldquo;rc&amp;rdquo; stands for release candidate). It was quite easy, all I had to do was:
git checkout master git pull git checkout v1.1.0-rc1 make 1h13min42sec latter, julia 1.</description></item><item><title>Building Sage 8.3 from sources on Debian Testing</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/sage/installsage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/sage/installsage/</guid><description>Sage is a powerful mathematics software I use to do symbolic computation. Currently, there is no version available for Debian Testing, meaning you can either install the version available for the stable release or cherry pick the package available for Sid. Well I was not able to sudo apt-get the package for Stretch so I decided to use the same approach as I did for Julia (see this previous note). Basically, the sources of sage are mirrored on Github so one can clone the repository:</description></item><item><title>Building Julia 1.0.0 from sources on Debian Testing</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/julia/juliav1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/julia/juliav1/</guid><description>You may have already heard about Julia. Well, I am not (yet) a regular user but Julia&amp;rsquo;s performances are impressive, the langage is well-thought and the community is growing super fast, I therefore pay careful attention to what&amp;rsquo;s happening on their side. Recently, version 1.0.0 was released, so I decided to replace my local version v0.4.7.9 I installed with apt-get (note that currently v0.7.0-2 is available for Sid).
There are two ways to install Julia for Debian without apt-get.</description></item></channel></rss>
