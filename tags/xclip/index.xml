Before going any further, I must admit that the subject is fairly technical and way beyond my expertise but I had to dig a bit cause I wanted to understand why I cannot do something very very helpful to me with Wayland so I read a bit.</description></item><item><title>Send a set of command lines to GNOME Terminal</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/paste2gnuterm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/paste2gnuterm/</guid><description>Context As mentioned several times on this website, I use Atom for my coding as well as for writing posts and manuscripts. While coding, one often needs to run commands in a terminal. To do so, I use specific Atom packages such as IDE-R or Julia Client to run R and Julia commands respectively and platformio-ide-terminal. The latter meets most of my expectations, but:
the terminal emulated is in a bottom panel and when I'm working on my laptop I cannot get a good overview of the code and the corresponding outputs at the same time, pretty annoying&amp;hellip; and having the terminal in the right panel is a feature unlikely to be implemented in a near future;</description></item></channel></rss>
