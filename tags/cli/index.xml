I actually knew about one CLI tool pdftotext 🔗 that converts a pdf file to a text file and I had this memory that I had used it for tables in the past. pdftotext is developed by Glyph &amp;amp; Cog with several other CLI tools to manipulate pdf files and the pdf viewer Xpdf.</description></item><item><title>Combine multiple pdf files</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/combinepdfs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/combinepdfs/</guid><description>For a recent job application, I needed to combine several pdf files into a single one and to number its pages afterwards. I already knew that I would be able to use PDFtk, a smart CLI tool I mentioned in a previous note to combine the pdf files but I was not sure how to proceed for the page numbering. Turns out that PDFtk is also useful for this too!</description></item><item><title>Send a set of command lines to GNOME Terminal</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/paste2gnuterm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/paste2gnuterm/</guid><description>Context As mentioned several times on this website, I use Atom for my coding as well as for writing posts and manuscripts. While coding, one often needs to run commands in a terminal. To do so, I use specific Atom packages such as IDE-R or Julia Client to run R and Julia commands respectively and platformio-ide-terminal. The latter meets most of my expectations, but:
the terminal emulated is in a bottom panel and when I&amp;rsquo;m working on my laptop I cannot get a good overview of the code and the corresponding outputs at the same time, pretty annoying&amp;hellip; and having the terminal in the right panel is a feature unlikely to be implemented in a near future;</description></item><item><title>Extract a range of pages from a .pdf file</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/pdftk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/pdftk/</guid><description>Today, I was looking for a way to extract pages from a pdf file with the command line interface and stumbled on this answer on , and so I decided to try PDFtk. After a quick installation (apt-get install pdftk), I simply reproduced the example in the answer with my file!
pdftk book.pdf cat 34-45 output chapter2.pdf Very handy, quite easy to use and efficient! Digging a little more the documentation, it turns out that you can do way more!</description></item><item><title>Multiple-protocol with aria2</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/aria2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/cli/aria2/</guid><description>People at TecMint wrote great posts and gatherhui tons of tips about Linux.

&amp;mdash; Linux Inside: The Ideal Blog for Sysadmins &amp;amp; Geeks (@tecmint) April 29, 2019 I gave it a try, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty sweet 😄!

After a quick search, I found two software: spd-say and espeak. They both offer the same basic options, similar to the ones say provides on MacOS.
spd-say spd-say was already included in the set of tools I install with Debian so I checked out the documentation with man spd-say:</description></item></channel></rss>
