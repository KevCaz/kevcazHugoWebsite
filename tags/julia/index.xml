Today, I comment on three strategies to run simulations for which the values taken by two arguments (or more) vary from one simulation to another.
The problem Let's assume that we run simulations by calling a Julia script myscript.jl that takes p1 as argument, in order to run the simulation on one CPU for a single simulation, I would run the following bas command</description></item><item><title>Submitting a Julia script with Slurm</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/computesci/juliaslurm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/computesci/juliaslurm/</guid><description>In a previous note, I've narrated my transition from Mammoth to Graham and I've exemplified how to submit an job with Slurm. As I'm currently using Julia for several projects, I'd like to report how I submitted my Julia script to the scheduler.
First of all, I needed to set up Julia for my account. As Graham runs under CentOS and as I had already loaded Julia v1.3.11, I just had to update the version of Julia with module.</description></item><item><title>Julia v1.1-rc1 from source</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/julia/juliav1-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/julia/juliav1-1/</guid><description>Learning more about Julia is one of the many things I attempt to do in 2019 😄. Few weeks ago, I installed Julia 1.0.0 using the GitHub repository and I decided to checkout how easy it would be to upgrade to the version to v1.1.0-rc1 (note that &amp;ldquo;rc&amp;rdquo; stands for release candidate). It was quite easy, all I had to do was:
git checkout master git pull git checkout v1.1.0-rc1 make 1h13min42sec latter, julia 1.</description></item><item><title>Building Julia 1.0.0 from sources on Debian Testing</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/julia/juliav1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/julia/juliav1/</guid><description>You may have already heard about Julia. Well, I am not (yet) a regular user but Julia's performances are impressive, the langage is well-thought and the community is growing super fast, I therefore pay careful attention to what's happening on their side. Recently, version 1.0.0 was released, so I decided to replace my local version v0.4.7.9 I installed with apt-get (note that currently v0.7.0-2 is available for Sid).
There are two ways to install Julia for Debian without apt-get.</description></item></channel></rss>
